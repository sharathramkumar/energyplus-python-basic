# energyplus-python-basic
In this notebook, we demonstrate how EnergyPlus can be used as a library within Python, so that a running simulation can be controlled by a Python script  

Pre-requisites:  
1. EnergyPlus v22.2 (any version >9.6 should work, must have Python API) 
2. An idf file describing the building and a weather file
